# Demo

This repository is for testing of turbosrc. It can be on Github, Gitlab, or even a self-hosted Gitea instance.

## Strategy

For now, we'll use a local gitea instance as we have full control of the testing environment that way, as opposed to testing of Github.

On the git-service, there are modules for interacting not only with git bu gitea. This is a work in-progress.
